        <!-- Our Story -->
        <section>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>BrightPath Community Care was founded in 2013 by a group of local community members who saw the growing need for family support services in our area. What began as a small food pantry operating out of a garage has now grown into a comprehensive support organization serving over 1,200 families annually.</p>
            
            <p>Our name, BrightPath, reflects our belief that every family deserves a clear path forwardâ€”one filled with hope, dignity, and opportunity. We work to remove barriers that prevent families from thriving, whether that's hunger, lack of clothing, or educational challenges.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> We treat everyone with dignity and respect</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> We believe in the power of collective action</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> We provide tools for self-sufficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We are transparent and accountable</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We continuously improve our services</li>
